**Method Exercises**

Methods allow you to structure your program such that the code to solve a particular problem is isolated from other code. This allows you to independently test that code and makes your program smaller by permitting code re-use. For an overview of methods see: Creating Methods.

Create one program which contains nine methods for each problem problem you select from the list below. You only have to select nine. You must use methods in writing your solutions.

Please try to keep all the logic to solve each problem in a method and use the main() method (from public static void main(String[] args) for calling the methods. The main method may also be used to interact with the user and display using the Scanner class and System.out.println statements.


Methods to implement (Choose nine):

Add two numbers given by the user.
Write an application to divide 2 numbers. Prompt the user to enter two numbers. Take the first number and divide it by the second number and print that result to the screen. If the second number is a zero, print "Undefined" to the screen, otherwise just print the result.

Get 5 letters from the user, output them sorted (Hint: Use ArrayList and Collections.sort())
Get the length of a string.
Get the average of 3 numbers.
Check if a year is a leap year (A leap year is divisible by 4).
Count all words in the sentence: The dog jumped over the fence (use String.split(" ") method).
Calculate the area of a rectangle with length and width input from the user. 
Print a 5 random numbers given a bound.
Given the array list, print a random word from the list: (module, class, implement).
Take integer input from the user, output whether it's odd or even.
The letter grade is determined as follows:
A = 90–100%
B = 80–89%
C = 70–79%
D = 60–69%
F = 0–59%
Write a program that will print the letter grade based on the percentage entered.
